# Non-Profit Personnel Management (Fall 2023)
A personnel management tool for non-profits to manage employees and volunteers developed as a group project for my Programming and Problem Solving II course. Using a CSV file (commandList.txt), the user can add, search, output, and remove employees and volunteers from the linked lists storing the data. The program validates input data and outputs any errors to a log file (errorReport.txt). Data is output to a text file (staffReport.txt).
